### TODO
- [ ] Create database
- [ ] Input test data
- [ ] Input test data from OL Control
- [ ] Create database backups on separate server

# OL Control (SOSI and TT&C Data Transfer)

## Setup / Dependencies
- In order to build a 32 bit version of an executable, need to use a 32-bit version of Python
  - Actually installed Python 3.4 (newest version of Python compatible with XP)
- Also tried compiling with go, but so far same issues. Might have most luck with Python.
- Python 3.4 success without executable, may not need to use one

## SOSI Data TODO
- [ ] Craft the payload in ol_control_send to look like TLE data
- [X] Write database for SOSI data (done: [TLE example](db/init.sql))
- [ ] Change ol_control_receive_34 to write to database instead of text file

## TT&C Data TODO
- [ ] Craft TT&C database schema
- [ ] Write TT&C data to database from web app
- [ ] Read data from database and send from ol_control_send
- [ ] Consider splitting ol_control to ol_ttc and ol_sosi



# OL Web Gateway (Web)

## TODO
- [ ] Create web front end to enter commands to send to space objects
